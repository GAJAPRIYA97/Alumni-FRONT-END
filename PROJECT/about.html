                This Web Application Project is called <strong>Web Based Alumni Management System</strong>. 
                This is my project at the time of comletting .NET Course in SOFT LOGIC SYSTEM. 
                It is originally written in HTML,CSS AND JAVASCRIPT. 
                This simple alumni Management web app is built for <strong>HOLY CROSS COLLEGE TRICHY, Bharathidasan University</strong>. 
                The system has an online form for the graduated student of the said University to track their employment status.
